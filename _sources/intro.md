```{tab-item} Things I learned
- The Jupyterbook guide provided through the "Helpful Links" in the assignment was very helpful. It provided good guidance and examples of code to do citations, directives, section labels, and more. Navigating these sections was a good learning experience. 
- The Markdown guide was helpful for formatting all the text. It was satisfying seeing all the normal text transform and become better organized. 
- I found the Module 8 slides and Piazza useful for when I encountered a problem or found something unclear. These resources, along with the guides mentioned above, taught me to be resourceful when encountering new areas I haven't worked with.

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Getting the Titanic image to appear was a struggle and took a lot of tries. The file path that I had to use was unclear and I had to try a few different paths to get the right one. 
- I found the instructions for putting the quote in a margin to be unclear. Overall the directives section is a an area I would like to practice with more.  
- There were often warnings when I tried to build the book. Troubleshooting these or figuring out why the book wouldn't build at parts was difficult - such as when the book wouldn't build because the incorrect kernel was being used. Debugging and troubleshooting is an area that I definitly need more practice with.
